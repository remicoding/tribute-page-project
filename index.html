                    "Maathai stood up courageously against the former oppressive regime in Kenya. Her unique forms of action 
                    have contributed to drawing attention to political oppression â€“ nationally and internationally. She has 
                    served as inspiration for many in the fight for democratic rights and has especially encouraged women to 
                    better their situation."<br><br>
